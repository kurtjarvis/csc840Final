# Bringing Offensive Cyber Operations Together

## General Information
* Author: Kurt Jarvis
* Date: 12/07/2021
* Description: This is a presentation that covers the basic concepts of Offensive Cyber Operations with leveraging a process, techniques, and usable results for improvement.

## Why You Should Care
This semester was a focus on multiple topics that were pieces of different aspects to offensive cyber operations. If you made it past chapter 5, you are probably committed to execution but how do we make it all work together to improve security? Here are the questions to ask yourself:
• How do I methodically go from no access to maximum access?
• How do I ensure that I don’t miss anything?
• How do I estimate effort and timelines?
• How do I explain this to the consumer?
• How do I explain this to the team who is going to fix it?

## Three Main Ideas
1. Lockheed Martin Kill Chain (How do I break this down into steps
2. Privilege Escalation Methodology (What am I trying to do)
3. MITRE ATT&CK (What are the techniques to get me where I wanna go)

## Future Direction
This should be fed into the Blue Team. MITRE has established another tool called “D3FEND” that links together the attack techniques with defense and visibility techniques.
